# Battle Tanks
A small head-to-head tank game based on the Unreal Developer course on UDemy

This small game is built over many lectures during the Unreal Editor Developer course on UDemy taught by Ben Tristem.  It is a very simple game with basic landscapes and controls.  It can be played by two players, or one player against a basic AI.  You are free to use this code if you wish.
